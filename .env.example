# Google Analytics 4 Integration Configuration
# 
# To integrate your dashboard with Google Analytics 4, follow these steps:

# 1. Your GA4 Property ID
# Replace YOUR_GA4_PROPERTY_ID with your actual GA4 Property ID
# You can find this in Google Analytics: Admin > Property Settings > Property ID
# Format: properties/XXXXXXXXX
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=properties/YOUR_GA4_PROPERTY_ID

# 2. Google Cloud Service Account (Optional but Recommended)
# For production use, create a service account key
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account-key.json

# 3. Your Google Analytics Measurement ID (already in use)
GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-GC4HBWCR8E

# Note: Keep this file secure and never commit credentials to version control
